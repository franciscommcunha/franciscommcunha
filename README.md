### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About me ðŸ¤– 

My name is Francisco, a computer nerd, but you can call me Chico. 
I love Android development and I worked as an Android developer from September 2019 until February 2023 at Talkdesk. Here I learned several things and I also had the chance to develop a KMM app. I also had the change to move to a backend team where I could learn some other tools (docker, spring, etc...)
At the moment I work at Usercentrics GMBH, where I am a member of the mobile team. Here I am helping to improve our sdk for mobile apps and also develop some other products.
Before all of this, I graduated and mastered in Computer Engineering and Telematics at the University of Aveiro, from 2014-2019.

# Projects I have been working ðŸ’»
You can see some of my projects in my profile developed during my academic course.

However, during the last few months, I have been developing an Android app all by myself. Check it on [Prize Card Checker](https://github.com/franciscommcunha/android-prize-card-checker-app)
