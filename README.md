### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About me ðŸ¤– 

My name is Francisco, a computer nerd, but you can call me Chico. 
I am an Android developer at Talkdesk, where I started in September 2019, developing in Kotlin.
Before that, I graduated and mastered in Computer Engineering and Telematics at the University of Aveiro, from 2014-2019.

# Projects I have been working ðŸ’»
You can see some of my projects in my profile developed during my academic course.

However, during the last few months, I have been developing an Android app all by myself. Check it on [Prize Card Checker](https://github.com/franciscommcunha/android-prize-card-checker-app)
